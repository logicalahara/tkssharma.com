Hi Folks,

I am Full stack developer and working on different platform in Javascript (Client/Server Side )and Java, I just explored the Kubernetes and wanted to share my experience on same

#### Where to Start

Learn Docker First in Depth

1. Docker image/build/container/Port mapping/Volume Mapping

1. Docker Internals

The event was centered around DevOps, for our talk Docker Saigon needed to interest an engineering audience with how things tick on the inside of Docker. Audience experience with Docker and Linux operating systems was expected.</small>

For Tutorials you can look for my git-book and Video Tutorials

Once we are done with Docker, then we can start Looking for Kubernetes, its Architecture deployment and all about it as its most popular tool to Orchestration of Containers.

[\*\*Kubernetes (K8s)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) is an open-source system for automating\*\* deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon [15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2898444), combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
